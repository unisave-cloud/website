<h2>2. Scope and Applicability of this DPA</h2>
<p>2.1 This DPA applies where and only to the extent that Unisave processes Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in
  the course of providing the Services and such Personal Data is subject to Data Protection Laws of the European Union,
  the European Economic Area and/or their member states, Switzerland and/or the United Kingdom. The parties agree to
  comply with the terms and conditions in this DPA in connection with such Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Role of the Parties.</strong> As between Unisave and Customer, Customer is the Controller of Personal
  Data and Unisave shall process Personal Data only as a Processor on behalf of Customer. Nothing in the Agreement or
  this DPA shall prevent Unisave from using or sharing any data that Unisave would otherwise collect and process
  independently of Customer's use of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Customer Obligations.</strong> Customer agrees that (i) it shall comply with its obligations as a
  Controller under Data Protection Laws in respect of its processing of Personal Data and any processing instructions it
  issues to Unisave; and (ii) it has provided notice and obtained (or shall obtain) all consents and rights necessary
  under Data Protection Laws for Unisave to process Personal Data and provide the Services pursuant to the Agreement and
  this DPA.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Unisave Processing of Personal Data.</strong> As a Processor, Unisave shall process Personal Data only
  for the following purposes: (i) processing to perform the Services in accordance with the Agreement; (ii) processing
  to perform any steps necessary for the performance of the Agreement; and (iii) to comply with other reasonable
  instructions provided by Customer to the extent they are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and only in
  accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions. The parties agree that this DPA and the Agreement set out
  the Customer’s complete and final instructions to Unisave in relation to the processing of Personal Data and
  processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between Customer and
  Unisave.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Nature of the Data.</strong> Unisave handles Customer Data provided by Customer. Such Customer Data may
  contain special categories of data depending on how the Services are used by Customer. The Customer Data may be
  subject to the following process activities: (i) storage and other processing necessary to provide, maintain and
  improve the Services provided to Customer; (ii) to provide customer and technical support to Customer; and (iii)
  disclosures as required by law or otherwise set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Unisave Data.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement (including this DPA),
  Customer acknowledges that Unisave shall have a right to use and disclose data relating to and/or obtained in
  connection with the operation, support and/or use of the Services for its legitimate business purposes, such as
  billing, account management, technical support, product development and sales and marketing. To the extent any such
  data is considered personal data under Data Protection Laws, Unisave is the Controller of such data and accordingly
  shall process such data in compliance with Data Protection Laws.</p>
<h2>3. Subprocessing</h2>
<p><strong>3.1 Authorized Sub-processors.</strong> Customer agrees that Unisave may engage Sub-processors to process
  Personal Data on Customer's behalf. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Unisave and authorized by Customer are
  listed in Annex A.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Sub-processor Obligations.</strong> Unisave shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with the
  Sub-processor imposing data protection terms that require the Sub-processor to protect the Personal Data to the
  standard required by Data Protection Laws; and (ii) remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this
  DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Sub-processor that cause Unisave to breach any of its obligations under this
  DPA.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Changes to Sub-processors.</strong> Unisave shall provide Customer reasonable advance notice (for which
  email shall suffice) if it adds or removes Sub-processors.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Objection to Sub-processors.</strong> Customer may object in writing to Unisave’s appointment of a new
  Sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection by notifying Unisave promptly in writing within five
  (5) calendar days of receipt of Unisave’s notice in accordance with Section 3.3. Such notice shall explain the
  reasonable grounds for the objection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view
  to achieving commercially reasonable resolution. If this is not possible, either party may terminate the applicable
  Services that cannot be provided by Unisave without the use of the objected-to-new Sub-processor.</p>
<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>4.1 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes
  of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
  Processor shall in relation to the Customer Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures
  to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in Article
  32(1) of the GDPR.</p>
<p>4.2 In assessing the appropriate level of security, Processor shall take account in particular of the risks that are
  presented by Processing, in particular from a Personal Data Breach.</p>
<h2>5. Audit Rights</h2>
<p>5.1 Processor shall make available to the Customer on request all information necessary to demonstrate compliance
  with this Agreement, and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, by the Customer or an
  auditor mandated by the Customer in relation to the Processing of the Customer Personal Data by the Contracted
  Processors.</p>
<p>5.2 Information and audit rights of the Customer only arise under section 5.1 to the extent that the Agreement does
  not otherwise give them information and audit rights meeting the relevant requirements of Data Protection Law.</p>
<h2>6. Data Transfer</h2>
<p>11.1 The Processor may not transfer or authorize the transfer of Data to countries outside the EU and/or the European
  Economic Area (EEA) without the prior written consent of the Customer. If personal data processed under this Agreement
  is transferred from a country within the European Economic Area to a country outside the European Economic Area, the
  Parties shall ensure that the personal data are adequately protected. To achieve this, the Parties shall, unless
  agreed otherwise, rely on EU approved standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data.</p>
<h2>7. Return or Deletion of Data</h2>
<p>7.1 Upon deactivation of the Services, all Personal Data shall be deleted, save that this requirement shall not apply
  to the extent Unisave is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or to Personal Data it
  has archived on back-up systems, which such Personal Data Unisave shall securely isolate and protect from any further
  processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<h2>8. Cooperation</h2>
<p>8.1 To the extent that Customer is unable to independently access the relevant Personal Data within the Services,
  Unisave shall (at Customer's expense) taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable cooperation
  to assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in so far as is possible, to respond to any
  requests from individuals or applicable data protection authorities relating to the processing of Personal Data under
  the Agreement. In the event that any such request is made directly to Unisave, Unisave shall not respond to such
  communication directly without Customer's prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If Unisave is
  required to respond to such a request, Unisave shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the
  request unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>
<p>8.2 To the extent Unisave is required under Data Protection Law, Unisave shall (at Customer's expense) provide
  reasonably requested information regarding Unisave's processing of Personal Data under the Agreement to enable the
  Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as
  required by law.</p>
<h2>9.Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>9.1 Except for the changes made by this DPA, the Agreement remains unchanged and in full force and effect. If there
  is any conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA shall prevail to the extent of that conflict.</p>
<p>9.2 This DPA is a part of and incorporated into the Agreement so references to "Agreement" in the Agreement shall
  include this DPA.</p>
<p>9.3 In no event shall any party limit its liability with respect to any individual's data protection rights under
  this DPA or otherwise.</p>
<p>9.4 This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the
  Agreement, unless required otherwise by Data Protection Laws.</p>
